									**Kickstarter Analysis**
**Overview of Project:**
---
The purpose of this project was to determine what decisions prove most successful to run a campaign to fund a play. The dataset included 1369 theater campaigns spanning 9 years and 1047 play campaigns. The data included campigns from all over the world and many different genres.

**Analysis and Challenges:**
---
**Analysis:** 
I preformed my analysis by looking at theater outcomes by launch date and play outcomes based on goals. Using this information allowed me to determine what months fared best to begin a campaign and what realistic goal should be set. 

**Challenges**
I did not run into any difficulties for this challenge. If I didn't have prior excel experience during my day to day life, I would anticipate difficulties with the countifs function. With all the different parts of the formula it is easy to make a mistake and miss important information. One thing I have found that helps is comparing the information pulled to the raw data page. By filtering for the raw data I was able to see my calculations were correct. If the numbers didn't match up, I could go through the formula to check for typos. 

**Results:**

**Conclusions based off Launch Date:**
   - May and June tend to be the most successful months for launching a fundraising campaign for theaters. 
   - Summer months (May - August) prove to be the most popular months to began a campaign, so we have the most data to extrapolate an analysis from. 
   - December - January are the least successful months to launch a campaign. This could be due to holidays, however, we would need more information to determine this. 
   - Theater campaigns tend to have a low number canceled.

**Conclusions from Outcomes by Goals:**
   - The lower the goal amount the better percent chance there is to be successful. You can see in the chart below that there is over a 70% success rate for those goals set 	         for  4999 and under but we see a decline with higher goals.
   - Goals higher than 4999 have a 50% or less success rate.
   - There is a small variance however in goals set from 35,000-44,999 where we start to see the campaigns overall fared better. However there is also a much smaller dataset to                  pull from so I wouldn't put much stock in this information.

***Based off the data, I would suggest starting a campaign in May for no more than 4,999 and running this campign for 2-3 weeks.***

**Limitations of the Dataset:**
---
I ran into a few limitations of the dataset. 
- We are using different currencies. In order to pull information that is the most accurate, we would want to look at either the data by currencies or calculate the currency to have it match. 
- We also didn't take into consideration the type of play, ex. we don't know if comedies fair better than love stories. This could provide us more information to determine if one genre did better than another. 
- I would have liked to know what percent the campaigns were looking to raise. Was the amount the full amount of the play or a portion. This could help when marketing the fundraiser.
- Although we know the conunty the campaign was launched in, we don't know the region/state. This information could be used for a more micro analysis of success. 
	
**Other Tables or Graphs:**
---
We could have looked at the length of time a campaign ran and if this changed the success rate. If we looked at this we could determine campaigns lasting for less than 1 month tend to be more successful.
