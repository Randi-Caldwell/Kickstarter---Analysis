**Overview of Project:**
---
The purpose of this project was to determine the most successful time to start a campaign as well as the amount to set the goal for. The dataset looked at included 1369 Theater campigns spanning 9 years and 1047 Play Campigns. The data was pulled included campigns from all over the world and many different genres.

**Analysis and Challenges:**
---
**Analysis:** 
I preformed my analysis by looking at theater outcomes by launch date and play outcomes based on goals. Using this information allowed me to determine what months fared best to begin a campaign (insert pivot table) and what a realistic should be set. 

**Challenges**
I did not run into any difficulties for this challenge. If I didn't have prior excel experience during my day to day life, I would anticipate difficulties with the countifs function. With all the different parts of the formula it is easy to make a mistake and miss important information. One thing I have found that helps is comparing the information pulled to the raw data page. By filtering for the raw data I was able to see my calculations were correct. If the numbers didn't match up, I could go through the formula to check for typos. 

**Results:**

**Conclusions based of Launch Date:**
	- May and June tend to be the most successful months for launching a fundraising campaign for theaters. 
	- Summer months (May -Aug) prove to be the highest months to began a campaign so we have the most data to extrapolate an analysis from. 
	- Theater campaigns tend to have a low number of campaigns that were canceled.

**Conclusions from Outcomes by Goals:**
	- The lower the goal amount the better % chance there is to be successful. You can see in the chart below that there is over a 70% successful rate for those goals set for  4999 and under but we see a decline the higher the goal is.
	- Goals higher than this have a 50% or less success rate. 
	- There is a small variance in goals set from 35,000-44,999 were we start to see the campaigns overall fared better. However there is also a much smaller dataset to pull from so I wouldn't put much stock in this information.

***Based off the data, I would suggest starting a campign in May for no more than 4,999 and running this campign for 2-3 weeks.***

**Limitations of the Dataset:**
---
I ran into a few limitations of the dataset. One was using different currencies. In order to pull information that is the most accurate, we would want to look at either the data by currencies or calculate the currency to have it match. Didn't take into consideration the type of play. We do not know if comedies fair better than love stories. This could provide us more information to determine if one genre did better than another. 
	
**Other Tables or Graphs:**
---
We could have looked at the length of time a campaign ran and if this changed the success rate. If we looked at this we could determine that running a campaign for less than 1 month tend to be more successful.
